<h3>Updates and new features:</h3>
<p>
  There was a major update to the database. The welcome page may display inconsistent data until all of your
  living vials have been flipped and have gone through one lifecycle. Please read the changelog carefully and
  familiarize yourself with new features. In case of questions, you can always contant
  <a href="mailto:radoslaw@ejsmont.net">webmaster</a> for support.

    <b>Flip-date updates</b><br/>
    <span class="muted">
      Flip date is now saved in the database and updated automatically when storage conditions change. As a result your
      old vials (that do not have flip-date saved in the database) will not appear in lists that depend on
      flip-date (due and overdue vials). All you new vials will behave properly. When the old vials die, issue fix get
      fixed.

    <b>Stable dependencies</b><br/>
    <span class="muted">
      As we are moving towards a stable release, the dependencies of the database have been fixed, so backward
      compatibility breaks should not happen anymore.
